
##What is NINJA-OPS?

---


NINJA is Not Just Another - OTU Picking Solution. Making use of BWT-enabled aligners, NINJA-OPS quickly generates an OTU map
and table from a given fasta file of sequence reads. NINJA-OPS also allows for convenient quality control on your data, such
as fast reverse complementing, base pair trimming, and a specialized denoising transformation.

NINJA-OPS can transform an entire MiSeq run into a QIIME-formatted biom table in under 10 minutes on your laptop, achieving higher accuracy and more exact matches than USEARCH.

Moreover, NINJA is entirely free and open source. 

The latest NINJA version can always be found on Github (https://github.com/GabeAl/NINJA-OPS) or at http://ninja-ops.ninja.

##Dependencies
---


Bowtie2
Python 2.7 for wrapper



##Installation
---



0. To use the wrapper, you need to have a version of Python 2.7 installed on your computer. If you have a recent version of the Mac OS or Linux/Unix OS then you will already have Python 2.7. You can test this by opening the terminal and typing "python". It will print the version. Then type "exit()" to quit. If you have Windows you may need to install Python. Python can be found at https://www.python.org/downloads/
1. Download and unzip the ninja package.
2. Download and unzip bowtie2 ( http://sourceforge.net/projects/bowtie-bio/files/bowtie2/ ). If you wish to use a different sequence aligner, you cannot run the wrapper ninja.py. Instructions below.
3. Copy the executable "bowtie2-align-s" and paste it to the main folder of the ninja package. Alternatively, you can add the bowtie2-align-s executable (or all Bowtie2 executables) to your system PATH variable.

IMPORTANT: Do not copy "bowtie2-align-s" to any other folder (for instance, bt2db). NINJA-OPS looks for bowtie2 only in the same folder ninja.py is located in, or on the system executable path.

##Instructions
---

###Normal usage
Simply run `python /path/to/your/ninja/directory/bin/ninja.py` in your command line to put your data through the entire NINJA pipeline. You will have to replace `/path/to/your/ninja/directory/bin/` with the proper filepath to your `ninja.py` file, which is in the `bin` directory in the NINJA-OPS folder.

Sample commands are as follows:

```
# Takes a fasta file as input (-i) and outputs its OTU map, OTU table and a
# list of sequences culled by NINJA to the default output folder
# ninja_output in your current working directory
python /path/to/ninja.py -i seqs.fna 

# Takes a fasta file as input (-i), reverse complements all reads within it
# (-r) and outputs its OTU map, OTU table and a list of sequences culled by
# NINJA to the folder ninja (-o)
python /path/to/ninja.py -i seqs.fna -o ninja -r

# Takes a fasta file as input (-i), trims all sequences down to 200 base pairs
# (-t 200), denoises data by discarding all reads that appear fewer than 3
# times and outputs to folder ninja (-o)
python /path/to/ninja.py -i seqs.fna -t 200 -d 3 -o ninja

# Takes a fasta file as input (-i) and runs bowtie2 with maximum sensitivity (-m max)
python /path/to/ninja.py -i seqs.fna -m max

# Takes a fasta file as input (-i) and runs bowtie2 with maximum speed (-m fast)
python /path/to/ninja.py -i seqs.fna -m fast

# Runs NINJA-OPS on paired-end data,
# Trimming from the end of the forward read to 150 base pairs
# and the beginning of the reverse read to 125 base pairs
# Allowing up to 600 bases length in the alignment from the start of the forward
# to the end of the reverse read
python /path/to/ninja.py -i forward.fna,reverse.fna -o ninja -I 600 -t 150 -T 125
```


###Custom usage
You can also run each step of the ninja pipeline individually. The steps are detailed below.

NOTE: When using Bowtie2, you must point Bowtie2 to the database files by prefix (such as "Ninja97" if your files are Ninja97blabla.bla) with absolute full path. Otherwise, bowtie will fail with internal error #2. Also, any typo in the commandlines given to it will fail with error #2.


0. (Optional if bowtie2 is included in this package) Ensure bowtie2 is installed and working with the included Ninja97 DB.
1. (Optional) Compile the c files with gcc. E.g. (you may have to replace * with each real ninja c filename):  
	```gcc -m64 -O3 -flto ninja_*.c -o ninja_*```
1b. OR use the included binaries
2. Run ninja_filter on your raw fasta reads. E.g. for an input "seqs.fna":  
	```./ninja_filter seqs.fna my_prefix```
You can include e.g, "170 RC" after that to trim at 170 bases and perform reverse complementing (doing it here is much faster than elsewhere).  
You can append D X.Y to the NINJA_filter commandline, where X is whole read (duplicate) filtering level and Y is the rarity threshold for k-mer filtering.
3. Run your filtered sequences through bowtie2 or other aligner with headerless SAM output. E.g. for 4 threads (p option) and 97% id (one plus the third parameter in --score-min) on seqs_filtered.fna with the db in directory /bt2db:  
	```bowtie2-align-s --no-head -x /bt2db/Ninja97 -S alignments.txt --np 0 --mp "1,1" --rdg "0,1" --rfg "0,1" --score-min "L,0,-.03" -k 1 --norc -p 4 -f seqs_filtered.fna```
	
For presets instead, specify e.g. ```--preset fast```

or ninjaMAX instead, use this combo: ```--no-head -x Ninja97 -S outTrial.txt --np 0 --mp "1,1" --rdg "0,1" --rfg "0,1" --score-min "L,0,-0.03" --norc -p 4 -f filtered.fa --very-sensitive -D 40 -R 4 -N 0 -L 10 -i "S,1,0.50"```
	
4. Run ninja_parse on the alignments, e.g. with the included 97 taxonomy mapping files masterDB97.map and taxmap97:  
	```./ninja_parse my_prefix alignments.txt masterDB97.map taxmap97.txt```
	
For legacy table output, add ``--legacy`` to the end of the command above
(Also, to log which sequences failed to align, add LOG at the very end of both ninja_filter and ninja_parse_filtered)


###Building a database
You can build your own marker gene database for use with NINJA-OPS. To do so, use ninja_prep in the /bin directory. 
The format of the input FASTA file must respect the formatting considerations outlined in formats_readme.txt in the root directory of NINJA-OPS. 
Once compiled, run ninja_prep in the following way: 

ninja_prep in_refs.fa out_preDB.fa DBNAME.db 

To use the resulting concatesome with bowtie2, simply download bowtie2-build and run:

bowtie2-build out_preDB.fa DBNAME

To create a taxonomy, simply generate a tab-delimited text file with two columns, the first containing the OTU ids, and the second containing the corresponding taxonomy in string form, semicolon-delimited if compartments are desired in BIOM format. No sorting is required as of v1.4. 

You may now place the 6 files starting with the name DBNAME_, as well as DBNAME.db, into a a folder named DBNAME within the "databases" directory of NINJA-OPS. 
Now NINJA-OPS may be invoked with custom database "DBNAME"
